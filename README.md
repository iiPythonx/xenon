# Xenon Streaming Engine

---

## ðŸ’¡ What Does This Code Do?

The script is designed to improve the performance of Roblox games by only rendering parts within a specified distance from the player. Parts that are too far away are stored in a separate folder (`ServerStorage.XenonParts`), which reduces the number of parts that need to be processed by the game engine.

## ðŸš¨ Features

- Customizable render distance (default is 50 studs)
- Customizable delay between player updates (default is 0.1 seconds)
- Customizable magnitude difference to trigger update (default is 10 studs)
- Option to ignore locked parts (baseplates, etc.)
- Option to change configuration via Value objects

## ðŸš¦ Getting Started

- Add the script to your game's `ServerScriptService`
- Create a folder in `Workspace` named "Xenon"
- Add all parts you want to stream to the "Xenon" folder
- If desired, add IntValue or BoolValue objects to the script to change its configuration
- Enjoy improved game performance!
